# Pygames Directory

Welcome to the **Pygames** directory! This section of the repository is dedicated to games developed in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library. Contributors are encouraged to submit their Pygame projects following the structure and guidelines outlined below.

## Folder Structure

Please follow this structure when adding your game project:

```
/pygames
    ├── /game_name              # Folder for each game project
    │     ├── main.py           # Main file to run the game
    │     ├── /assets           # (Optional) Images, sounds, and other assets
    │     ├── README.md         # Documentation for the game
    ├── README.md               # General documentation (this file)
```

### Example Structure
For example, if you're submitting a game called "Space Invaders":
```
/pygames
    ├── /space_invaders
    │     ├── main.py
    │     ├── /assets
    │     ├── README.md
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Folder Creation**: Create a separate folder for your game under the `/pygames` directory. Name the folder after your game (e.g., `/space_invaders`).
   
2. **Game File**: Place your game's main Python file as `main.py` inside your game's folder.

3. **Assets**: If your game uses images, sounds, or other assets, include them in an `/assets` folder within your game folder.

4. **README for Each Game**: Add a `README.md` inside your game's folder. This file should include:
   - **Description**: A brief overview of the game.
   - **Installation**: Instructions on how to install dependencies and run the game.
   - **Controls**: Information on the game's controls.
   - **Screenshots**: Include gameplay screenshots in the `/assets` folder and link them in the README.

5. **Dependencies**: List any required packages in a `requirements.txt` file. Ensure that `pygame` is listed if needed.

## General Contribution Rules

1. **Pygame Usage**: Ensure that your game uses the Pygame library.
   
2. **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and modular code. Comment where necessary to explain complex sections.

3. **Testing**: Test your game thoroughly to make sure it runs without errors.

4. **Naming**: Use descriptive names for files and assets to make them easily identifiable.

5. **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful commit messages, detailing the changes or features added.

## Example README for Your Game

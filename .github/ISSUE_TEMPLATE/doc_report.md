## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to assist users and contributors by providing clear instructions on how to navigate the project, implement features, and maintain code quality.

## Folder Structure

Please follow this structure when organizing project files:

```
/Project_Name
    ├── /src                    # Source code for the project
    ├── /tests                  # Unit tests for the project

2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for files and folders (e.g., `feature_x.py`, `test_feature_x.py`).
3. **Documentation**: Ensure that every module or feature has corresponding documentation in the `/docs` folder.
4. **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards and write clean, modular code. Refer to the project's coding style guide, if available.
5. **Testing**: Include unit tests for all new features and ensure that they pass before submitting a pull request.

## Documentation Structure

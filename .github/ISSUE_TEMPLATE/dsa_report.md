# DSA Challenges in Python

This directory contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges in Python. Each challenge focuses on key DSA concepts to help improve problem-solving skills.

## Folder Structure

Please follow this structure when adding solutions:

```
/DSA_in_Python
    ├── /algorithms            # Algorithm challenges (e.g., sorting, searching)
    ├── /data_structures       # Data structure challenges (e.g., linked lists, trees)
    ├── /tests                 # Unit tests for algorithms and data structures
    ├── /utils                 # Helper functions or utilities
    └── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Organize Solutions**: Place each solution in the relevant folder.
2. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `binary_search.py`, `linked_list.py`).
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for each solution in the `/tests` folder.
4. **Code Quality**: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) and write clean, modular code with comments.
5. **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful, descriptive commit messages.
6. **Add Screenshots**: Include a screenshot of the output for each challenge. Place the screenshot in a new `screenshots` folder and link it in the respective file or the README.

## Adding Output Screenshots

After running your solution, take a screenshot of the output. Place it in the `/screenshots` folder and name it according to the challenge (e.g., `binary_search_output.png`). Then, link the screenshot to the corresponding challenge like this:

Example:
```
### Binary Search
![Binary Search Output](./screenshots/binary_search_output.png)
```

## Folder Structure

Ensure you follow this structure when adding new files or features:

```
/DSA_in_Python
    ├── /algorithms            # Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, etc.)
    ├── /data_structures       # Data structure implementations (linked lists, trees, etc.)
    ├── /tests                 # Unit tests for algorithms and data structures
    ├── /utils                 # Helper functions and utilities
    └── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Make your changes, following the [Coding Standards](#coding-standards) below.
4. Ensure that your code is well-documented and tested.
5. Submit a pull request and wait for review.

## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines for Python code.
- Keep code modular and reusable.
- Write meaningful docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Avoid deeply nested code. Refactor when necessary.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow this format for commit messages:

```
<type>: <subject>

Body (optional)
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:

```
feat: Add binary search algorithm

Added an implementation of binary search with time complexity details.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your changes pass all tests.
2. Write clear descriptions for your pull request, explaining the purpose of the changes.
3. Tag your pull request with appropriate labels.
4. Wait for approval from a project maintainer.
